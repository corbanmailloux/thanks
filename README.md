# thanks.corb.co

[thanks.corb.co](http://thanks.corb.co) is a thanks GIF randomizer.

I made a silly "thanks" GIF as a joke at my office, so I wanted a fun way to send it to people. "thanks.corb.co" started being used as a phrase in chat conversations, so I made a series of several thanks GIFs and made a quick randomizer.
